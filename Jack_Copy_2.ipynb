    "# 1.0 Using Machine Learning to Determine Predictability of NHL Stanley Cup Winners Based on Regular Season Data\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Background And Motivation\n",
    "The National Hockey League crowns its winner every year by awarding the Stanley Cup to the champion of the league playoffs. In a 31 team league (30 teams prior to the 2017-2018 season), 16 teams make the playoffs, where a team must win four best-of-seven series' to become the champion. In past years, these winners have seemed to show little to no correlation to regular season performance, and guessing a winner is often attributed to luck. Despite this believe, there is reason to believe that this is not the case, and a deeper look into statistics is just required to determine a winner. \n",
    "\n",
    "If successful, this model can be applied to gambling, where bets can be made corresponding to the results of the model, in hopes of accurately predicting a winner to gain a profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to determine whether a team's regular season statistics are indicative of how they will perform in the playoffs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Methodology\n",
    "The data was collected from http://www.nhl.com/stats/teamsaggregate=0&reportType=season&seasonFrom=20102011&seasonTo=20192020&gameType=2&filter=gamesPlayed,gte,1&sort=points,wins&page=0&pageSize=50 and https://stathead.com/hockey/tpbp_finder.cgi#stats::none, with the former being regular season and playoff data for individual teams, and the latter being advanced regular season analytics. The data was collected from the past 10 NHL seasons, excluding the 2019-2020 NHL season (which was shortened due to COVID). \n",
    "\n",
    "With the use of machine learning and PCAs, there is hope create a model that can predict a team's performance with accuracy based on their regular season statistics. To do this, thirty-seven regular season statistics were used. The number of components used in the model was determined by a for loop that tested the accuracy of 37 models which each had a different number of components (from 1 to 37). The best combination of components for each model was determined using a PCA. The accuracy of each of the models was then measured, and the best model (and thus the ideal number of components) was determined.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, three paramaters were tested using GridSearchCV to determine the best paramater of the given inputs. The three parameters tested were the gamma value, the C value, and the kernel type (linear or rbf). Once the ideal values were determined, a model was created (using the paramater values determined by GridSearchCV) and the accuracy could be tested. \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether the model was successful in its prediction or not, a goal of an accuracy score of 0.80 was set. "

    "## 1.4   General Statistics\n",
    "In the first step, general statistics that are available to the public will be imported and analyzed. The statistics being tested will be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals Against Per Game (GA/GP): The expectation is that there will be a strong negative correlation between Goals Against Per Game and Win percentage, as the more goals a team allows often results in a higher probability of that team losing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plus-Minus: This is a statistic that measures the net goals for a team (a team's goals minus the goals they have allowed). The expectation is that there will be a strong positive correlation between plus-minus and win percentage since it provides a macroscopic view of the net score in a hockey game. \n",
    "\n",
    "Shots/game: This is a statistic that measures the average amount of shots taken on net by a team in a game. Once again, it is expected that there will be a strong correlation between the amount of shots taken in a game and the win percentage of a hockey team, since the more shots a team generates, the more opportunities they have to score. \n",
    "\n",
    "Faceoff Win Percentage: This is a statistic that measures the percentage of times a team wins a faceoff (which occurs at the start of every play in hockey). Since this is an indirect measurement of possesion of the puck, it is expected that there will be a positive correlation between faceoff win percentage and win percentage; however, it is not expected to be a strong correlation due to the many changes of possesion that occur during a hockey game.
